EC2 --> jar, war, docker

AWS Elastic Bean Stalk  : Create Application 

--> VPC 
--> IAM - Role - Permissions 
 
Step 0: 
IN your application, change the port no. to 5000. As AWS uses Nginx to run the application and that by default works on 5000. 

Build the app using Maven Install, and test jar file using command: 

java -jar <jarfile-name>


Step 1: Elastic Bean Stalk 
	--> Create Application
	--> Create a Domain (rdsecapp.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com) 
	--> Platform
	    jar: java, docker image:docker, war: tomcat 
	--> Select Correto 8 if you are using JDK 1.8.  
	--> Upload jar file from local file system 
click next 
Step 2: 
Configure service access 
[you must a create a service role, and attach proper permission to it.]

	--> Create role 
	--> Select UseCase: EC2
	--> Attach permission to the role 
	    1. AWSElasticBeanstalkEnhancedHealth
	    2. AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier	
	--> role name: hex_oct_ec2

Click Create Role

Step 3: 
Go back to Bean Stalk Service Access Tab and In Existing Service Role, select the role that you just created(you might have to press refresh button given there)

IN EC2 instance profile drop down, select the same above role. 

Step 3: Create a custom VPC: Virtual Private Cloud 

Search for VPC in console serach bar and click on "create VPC" : hex-vpc

CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/28 - reserves 16 IPs 
AZs: 1
Public subnet: 1
Private Subnet: 0

From the drop down: select the VPC that you created : hex-vpc

IN Instance Setting, select the subnet 

Step 4: Configure instance traffic and scaling

In Instance types, Only select t3.micro

Step 5: Configure updates, monitoring, and logging

IN Health reporting, select Basic

Deselect Managed Updates.
